## Project Overview

This project is a Game I built for my Java Development course. This project was the final project for the
class and took a semester to complete. I spent 140 hours on the project. The goal was to create an
interactive game. I chose to build a game where players try to beat "The Riddler" by answering ten
riddles correctly with only 60 seconds to guess each riddle. Currently at Alpha.
